### Order in which scripts should be run

1.  Generate esets (rda files) for a dataset
    • Run MetaPhlAn2.R or HUMAnN2.R script to produce the esets. 
      (When running the HUMAnN2.R script, make sure that Pheno.Data.txt 
      file is present in the working directory, so that the rda-files could 
      be populated with the pheno-data information.)

2.  Annotate esets
    • Place all the rda-files in a directory. (Don’t call it the 
      working directory)
    • Run the Annotate_esets.R script while making sure that the 
      Experiment.Data.txt file is being present in the working directory.

3.  Produce Help-Page
    • Place all the (annotated) rda-files in a directory. (Call it 
      the working directory)
    • Then run the Help_esets.R script to produce a help-page for the dataset.

4.  Exception
    • Use the customized scripts to read WT2D, Zeller and Neilsen datasets.
      I.  HUMAnN2_WT2D.R, 
      II. HUMAnN2_Zeller.R and 
      III.HUMAnN2_Neilsen.R
