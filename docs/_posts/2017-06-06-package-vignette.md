The curatedMetagenomicData vignette and manual are the first places to look to learn how to use the package. These are available in the [release](bioconductor.org/packages/curatedMetagenomicData) and [development](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/curatedMetagenomicData.html) versions on  Bioconductor. The newest functionality and datasets will only be available on the development version or by installing from Github, see [installation instructions](https://waldronlab.github.io/curatedMetagenomicData/getting-started/).
